//       frames are exactly vrate.den ticks apart. Frames are dropped
//       or duplicated if necessary to maintain this spacing.

//       end time divided by number of frames so far) is never allowed to be
//       greater than vrate.den and frames are dropped if necessary
//       to keep the average under this value. Other than those drops, frame
//       times are left alone.

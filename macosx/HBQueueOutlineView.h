//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// As usual, we need to subclass NSOutlineView to handle a few special cases:
//
// (1) variable row heights during live resizes
// HBQueueOutlineView exists solely to get around a bug in variable row height outline
// views in which row heights get messed up during live resizes. See this discussion:
// http://lists.apple.com/archives/cocoa-dev/2005/Oct/msg00871.html
// However, the recommended fix (override drawRect:) does not work. Instead, this
// subclass implements viewDidEndLiveResize in order to recalculate all row heights.
//
// (2) prevent expanding of items during drags
// During dragging operations, we don't want outline items to expand, since a queue
// doesn't really have children items.
//
// (3) generate a drag image that incorporates more than just the first column
// By default, NSTableView only drags an image of the first column. Change this to
// drag an image of the queue's icon and desc columns.

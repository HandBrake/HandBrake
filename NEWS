0.9.3 Snapshot 3 -> 0.9.3 Snapshot 4 (r1896)
Core Library
- Converts video in other color spaces to YUV420 (this means DV support)
- Official, standards-based AC3-in-MP4
- Tries to base the AV timing for streams off audio when possible
- Keeps some audio fixes for lost packets in over the air streams from interfering with other sources
- Handles rendering of sources where the picture resolution changes mid-stream (this fixes the long-standing bug reading a particular episode of Doctor Who)
- Wider window for clock references (AV sync)

- Rejiggered verbose activity log display to be more laconic by default
- Updated x264 to r1016, which means b-rdo and bime are gone and replaced with new subme modes

- Added resizeable update window
- Fixed parsing of non-DVD source audio formats

- Fixed reading of device paths in OS X

A special note on the new presets (they're collapsible-triangle-folder-thing-errific!)
- Deux Six Quatre, Blind, Broke, and Bedlam are gone. They were dead weight.
- iPod Low-Rez is now iPod Classic & iPod Nano
- iPod High-Rez is now iPod Legacy
- iPhone / iPod Touch is now iPhone & iPod Touch, so take care CLI users
- Animation and Television now use the decomb and detelecine (VFR) filters
- High Profile presets now use psy-trellis and the new subme 9 mode with B-frame RD refinement
- AppleTV is now CRF, so sizes will vary with content
- PS3 preset should be fixed
- Constant Quality Rate still needs its quality % lowered, probably

The keen reader is already asking "iPod Legacy? WTF is iPod High-Rez called iPod Legacy now?"

The answer is Universal.

The Universal preset is designed to play on all modern iPods (anything newer than the iPod 5.5G). It also plays on iPhones. It also plays on AppleTVs. It should also play just about anywhere else, hence the name. It is full anamorphic DVD resolution--no tricks with downscaling like stuff from the iTunes Store. It includes chapters, and has the first audio track in both AAC (DPL2 downmixed) and AC3 pass-thru, just like the AppleTV preset. In fact, it should give the same quality as the AppleTV preset, but faster...and at a larger file size. Like the AppleTV preset, it used CRF, so sizes will vary.

0.9.3 Snapshot2 -> 0.9.3 Snapshot 3 (r1797)
Core Library:
- Universal input support, utilizing libavcodec from the FFmpeg project for decoding non-MPEG-2 video

- Support for New Zealand and Norwegian HDTV broadcasts (H.264 and AAC-LATM in MPEG-TS)
- Detelecine is now "VFR detelecine" by default, dropping some frames and extending others to make up lost time, old behavior of keeping duplicate frames is enabled by selecting a framerate besides "Same as source"
- Threaded deinterlacing in Slow and Slower modes
- Threaded and entirely rewritten decomb filter
- Better audio resampling interpolator
- Better gamma in QuickTime through the use of the COLR MP4 atom
- Better constant quality encoding when using FFmpeg
- Hopefully better cache and virtual memory performance by recycling buffers that were most recently used instead of least
- Fix for MP4s with "negative duration" errors.
- Set the detelecine filter to work better with PAL by using "loose" breaks
- Fix for missing initial H.264 NAL units, improves reliability of 8x8dct
- Fix for subtitle-scan with XviD encoding

- Updates for libsamplerate, libogg, xvidcore, libtheora, libmpeg2, lame, faac, and of course ffmpeg and x264.

Mac GUI
- Entirely rewritten and far more flexible queue that can be saved between sessions, capable of preserving queued items after a crash

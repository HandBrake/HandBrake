NEWS file for HandBrake <http://handbrake.fr/>

Changes between 0.10.1 and 0.10.2

  - Assorted bug fixes and performance improvements.


Changes between 0.10.0 and 0.10.1

  - Assorted bug fixes for all three GUI's and the core library.

 

Changes between 0.9.9 and 0.10

  Core
    - Intel QuickSync Video Encode / Decode support. (Beta)
        Windows only currently. We hope to bring this to Linux user in the future.
    - DXVA Hardware Decode support (Experimental)
        Windows Only.
        Suitable only for slower machines so disabled in preferences by default.
    - Choice of Scalers
        Lanczos
            HandBrakes? default scaler.
        Bicubic (OpenCL) (Experimental)
            Available on the Command Line (All Platforms) and Windows GUI. (Mac / Linux GUI's will come in a later release)
            Currently only available in OpenCL form so requires a AMD or Intel GPU supporting OpenCL 1.1 or later. Nvidia GPU's are not currently supported.
            When downscaling, up to 5% performance improvement can be achieved. No benefit when not downscaling.
            Small loss in quality over the Lanczos scaler.
    -   Denoise
        hqdn3d filter now accepts individual settings for both chroma channels (Cr, Cb)
        New NlMeans? denoiser. This is very slow, but results are significantly better than hqdn3d.
    - Presets
        Added Windows Phone 8 Preset
    - Updated Libraries
        x264 r2479-dd79a61
        Libav v10.1
        libbluray 0.5.0
    - Libavformat is now used for muxing instead of mp4v2 and libmkv
        "Large File Size" checkbox has now bee removed for mp4, as the new muxer will transition to 64bit files automatically.
        mpeg2dec has also been replaced in favour of using libav
    - The LibAV AAC encoder is now the default as FAAC has been removed.
        This encoder is adequate for most, but until it improves a bit further, we have enabled support for the FDK-AAC encoder also.
            This FDK option is a temporary measure until the LibAV encoder improves.
            Note that FDK-AAC is much slower and will likely bottleneck the encode process, but will produce better quality audio.
    - H.265 encoder
        is now available through x265 1.4. While this encoder is still fairly new, we have seen some promising results come out of it. It's still under heavy active development and is only going to improve over time!
    - Added VP8 Encoder (using libvpx)
        Available in MKV files only.
    - Removed mcdeint deinterlace and decomb modes. This relied on the snow encoder in libav which has been was removed by upstream.
    - Bug fixes and Misc Improvements

  Windows
    - Accessibility / Usability Improvements
        Added option to 'Use System Colors'. The app should now be usable in a High Contrast mode.
        Fixed Tab ordering to make the app more keyboard friendly.
    - LibHB is now used for scanning instead of the CLI.
        Experiential Preview window is now available as a result. (Can be enabled via preferences)
    - Improved the layout and design of the Audio and Subtitle tabs.
        Split buttons similar to the old 0.9.8 WinForms? GUI
        Improved layout on the track listbox to make better use of the space.
    - Improvements to Auto-Naming feature.
    - When Done
        Added an option that will reset this to 'Do nothing' when the app is closed and restarted.
    - Presets
        New 'Presets' Menu
        Presets bar can now be hidden if it's not wanted.
    - Numerous bug fixes
        Fixed the Issue in the source dropdown where the drive menu items did not work when clicked.
        Numerous fixes in the Picture settings panel around resolution calculation.
        Numerous fixes around the way Presets are loaded and saved, particularly around Picture settings.
        Removed Growl for Windows support due to bugs and issues with this library that remain unfixed. Project appears abandoned.
        Many misc other fixes.
    - Windows XP is no longer supported. Windows Vista with Service Pack 2 or later is now a requirement.
    - The 32bit build of the application is now considered deprecated. This is due to 32bit process memory limitations.

    - Optimize MP4 for web download works with AC3 tracks now

    Mac GUI
    - Nested presets
    - Individual activity logs for each encode (stored by default in ~/Application Support/HandBrake, can be co-located with encoded file destination by preference)
    - Allows reading from ZFS volumes
    - Fixed target size mode. It keeps breaking itself. Maybe it should just be put out of its misery...

    - Nested presets
    - Individual activity logs for each encode
    - Allows pending queue items to be removed, and reloaded in the main window for editing
    - Better handling of HD previews
    - Assorted other improvements

    A special note on the new presets (they're collapsible-triangle-folder-thing-errific!)
    - Deux Six Quatre, Blind, Broke, and Bedlam are gone. They were dead weight.
    - iPod Low-Rez is now iPod Classic & iPod Nano
    - iPod High-Rez is now iPod Legacy
    - iPhone / iPod Touch is now iPhone & iPod Touch, so take care CLI users
    - Animation and Television now use the decomb and detelecine (VFR) filters
    - High Profile presets now use psy-trellis and the new subme 9 mode with B-frame RD refinement
    - AppleTV is now CRF, so sizes will vary with content
    - PS3 preset should be fixed
    - Constant Quality Rate still needs its quality % lowered, probably

    The keen reader is already asking "iPod Legacy? WTF is iPod High-Rez called iPod Legacy now?"

    The answer is Universal.

    The Universal preset is designed to play on all modern iPods (anything newer than the iPod 5.5G). It also plays on iPhones. It also plays on AppleTVs. It should also play just about anywhere else, hence the name. It is full anamorphic DVD resolution--no tricks with downscaling like stuff from the iTunes Store. It includes chapters, and has the first audio track in both AAC (DPL2 downmixed) and AC3 pass-thru, just like the AppleTV preset. In fact, it should give the same quality as the AppleTV preset, but faster...and at a larger file size. Like the AppleTV preset, it used CRF, so sizes will vary.

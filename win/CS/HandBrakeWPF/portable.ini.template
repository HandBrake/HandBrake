#################################
# Notes:
# - Rename this file to portable.ini to activate feature.
#
# - storage.dir =>                Stores Presets, Settings and Log Files. (See Note 1)
# - tmp.dir =>                    Temporary files only. i.e Preview images (See Note 1)
# - update.check =>               true | false (false disables the update check preference and disables update checking completely. true enables user-choice.)
# - hardware.enabled =>           true | false (Enables the hardware encoders such as QSV, NVENC or VCE)
# - process.isolation.enabled =>  true | false (See Note 2)
# - software.render =>            true | false (Only set to true if you are experiencing UI corruption or glitches)
# - theme.enabled =>              true | false (default true, false disables dark and light themes and uses stock framework appearence.)
#
# Note 1:
#   Set to 'cwd' to use the current applications directory. It will automatically create "storage" and "tmp" folders in this instance.
#   Leave blank to use the system "TMP" directory and the "AppData" user profile folder.
# Note 2:
#	Process Isolation uses an HTTP server on 127.0.0.1 port 8037 or within +100 if in use. 
#   This is 'HandBrake.worker.exe' and it is designed to protect the user interface and queue should one job cause an application crash.
#   Disabled by default for portable mode, but recommended to turn it on.

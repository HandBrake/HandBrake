# HandBrake Portable
#################################
# Notes:
# - Rename this file to portable.ini to activate feature.
#
# - storage.dir => Stores Presets, Settings and Log Files.
# - tmp.dir => temporary files only. (i.e Preview images)
# - update.check =>  true | false   (false disables the update check preference and disables update checking completely. true enables user-choice.)
# - hardware.enabled => true | false (Enables the hardware encoders such as QSV, NVENC or VCE)
# - process.isolation.enabled => true | false 
#	(Process Isolation uses an HTTP server on 127.0.0.1 port 8037 or within +100 if in use. This is 'HandBrake.worker.exe' and it is designed to protect the user interface and queue should one job cause an application crash.)
#   (Disabled by default for portable mode, but recommended to turn it on.) 
# - software.render => true | false  (Only set to true if you are experiencing UI corruption or glitches)
#
# Set to 'cwd' to use the current applications directory. It will automatically create "storage" and "tmp" folders in this instance.
# Leave blank to use the system "TMP" directory and the "AppData" user profile folder.

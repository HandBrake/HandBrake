HandBrake License

Most files in HandBrake are under the GNU General Public License Version 2
(GPLv2) license; read the file COPYING for details.

Some files are under the GNU General Public License Version 2 or any later
version (GPLv2+), the GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2.1 or any later
version (LGPLv2.1+), or BSD/MIT/X11-style licenses. 

In any case, a compiled HandBrake build is licensed under GPLv2 
and the terms of that license take effect. 

The Fraunhofer AAC library (fdk-aac) is under a license incompatible with the
GPLv2 license. Since both licenses cannot be satisfied simultaneously, binaries
resulting from the combination of HandBrake and fdk-aac are neither free nor
redistributable. As a result, fdk-aac is by default not included in HandBrake.
If you wish to include fdk-aac in your personal build of HandBrake, you may do
so by passing --enable-fdk-aac to configure and making sure not to distribute
any resulting binaries. Please read the fdk-aac license for details.

HandBrake makes use of 3rd party libraries which will be licensed under a GPL-compatible license.
These are listed in the THANKS file.

Graphic assets are covered by the license(s) specified in graphics/LICENSE.

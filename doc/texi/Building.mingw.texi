@chapter Prerequisites
The following are the recommended specifications for building on @value{OS.mingw}; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is possible:

@itemize @bullet
@item Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware
@item @value{OS.mingw} on Fedora 17+, Ubuntu 12+ or Debian, gcc 4.6+
@item yasm 1.2.x (for i386 or x86_64 architectures)
@end itemize

@include building/prerequisites.bundled.texi

@quotation Note
You must set the --cross flag with configure to cross compile with windows.
See the Example below. Note that the cross compiler name varies between distributions.

As of this writing, @value{OS.mingw} has available to it several versions of gcc; only one of which may be found and used in the path as @code{gcc} and @code{g++}. Configure will thus find what is probably the older version of gcc in a typical @value{OS.mingw} environment. If you desire to build with the newer gcc, it is found in the path as @command{gcc-4} and @command{g++-4} respectively and you must indicate to configure the desired versions. The following syntax should do the trick:

@example
../configure --cross=i686-w64-mingw32 --gcc=gcc-4
@end example

@value{OS.mingw} builds are performed from a @b{terminal}. There is no support for building from any IDEs.

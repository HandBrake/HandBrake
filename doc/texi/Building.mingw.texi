@chapter Prerequisites
The following are the recommended specifications for building on @value{OS-mingw}; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is possible:

@itemize @bullet
@item Intel 64-bit hardware
@item @value{OS-mingw} on Fedora 20+, Ubuntu 14+ or Debian 7+ using gcc 4.7+
@item Official MinGW-w64 builds are recommended over those provided by distributions.
@item yasm 1.2 or newer 
@end itemize


@quotation Note
We use MinGW-w64 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/?source=navbar

Please see "Toolchains targetting Win64" -> "Automated Builds" and choose the latest version.

At the time of writing, "mingw-w64-bin_x86_64-linux_20131228.tar.bz2" is used.

@quotation Note2
You must set the --cross flag with configure to cross compile with windows.
See the Example below. Note that the cross compiler name varies between distributions.

The following is an example:

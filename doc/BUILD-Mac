1 Introduction
**************

This guide documents the recommended process to build HandBrake on Mac
OS X hosts from the official source-code repository.  Building from any
other source is not supported.

2 Prerequisites
***************

Building on Mac OS X is well supported.  It is the reference platform
for HandBrake.  The following are the recommended specifications for
this platform; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is
possible:

   * Mac Intel hardware
   * Mac OS X 10.7.5 or Mac OS X 10.8.3
   * Xcode 4.6.1 (4H512)
   * llvm-gcc-4.2 version 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc.  build 5658) (LLVM
     build 2336.11.00)
   * Xcode command-line tools (installed via Preferences > Downloads >
     Components)
   * XQuartz (http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/)

The following tools are compiled during the build process if necessary,
but you can speed up your build by installing them:

   * yasm 1.2.0 or later
   * autoconf
   * automake
   * libtool

     Note: It is recommended to use the platform distribution's standard
     compiler for maximum C++ compatibility.  If you build with a custom
     compiler it will likely introduce non-standard runtime requirements
     and have new/delete, exception and RTTI incompatibilities.  There
     are of course many valid reasons to build with unbundled compilers,
     but be aware it is generally unsupported and left as an exercise to
     the reader.
The following general tools are used on various platforms and it is
recommended you use these versions or similar:

   * subversion - 1.6.16
   * python - Python 2.7.1
   * curl - curl 7.21.4 (or wget)
   * m4 - GNU M4 1.4.6
   * make - GNU Make 3.81
   * patch - Patch 2.5.8
   * tar - GNU tar 1.26
   * wget - GNU Wget 1.13.4 (or curl)

3 QuickStart
************

This chapter is for building from a terminal/shell environment in as few
commands as possible.  Upon completion of the following commands you
should have a fresh build of HandBrake.  Further instructions are
available beginning with *note overview:: which describes procedures
suitable for repeating builds.  This chapter should be skipped by those
seeking more than a minimalist build.

     svn checkout svn://svn.handbrake.fr/HandBrake/trunk hb-trunk
     cd hb-trunk
     ./configure --launch

The special option '--launch' selects launch mode and performs the
following steps:

   * assert scratch directory 'build/' does not exist
   * create scratch directory 'build/'
   * change to directory 'build/'
   * launch 'make'
   * capture build output to 'build/log/build.txt'
   * echo build output
   * print elapsed time
   * indicate if build ultimately succeeded or failed

4 Overview
**********

The two general methods to build on Mac OS X are from terminal or
Xcode.app.  The preferred method for automated and repeatable builds is
to use the terminal.  Otherwise the choice is generally up to the
individual.  To be extra clear, building from the terminal by default
actually invokes 'xcodebuild' to build the very same targets contained
in the Xcode project.  Think of it as building with Xcode but without
the GUI.

5 Building via Terminal
***********************

5.1 Checkout Sources
====================

Checkout HandBrake from the official source-code repository.

     svn checkout svn://svn.handbrake.fr/HandBrake/trunk hb-trunk
     cd hb-trunk

Sources are checked out from the 'trunk' branch.  This document was
generated from that very branch, and for example purposes, we will use
exactly the same branch.

If you have write-access to the repository, then you may add the
appropriate login/password information as needed.  It is recommended to
use Subversion 1.6.0 or higher.  Lower versions should also work.

5.2 Configure
=============

Configure the build system.

     ./configure

Configure will automatically create a scratch build directory 'build'
unless you use GNU-style build procedures and first 'cd' to a directory
other than top-level source.  Additionally you may use '--build' to
specify the directory.  The name of the directory is arbitrary but it is
recommended to use something which indicates transient files which are
not checked into the repository.

The 'configure' utility accepts many options.  It is recommended that
you specify '--help' for the complete list of options.  The following
options are also documented here:

'--help'
     List available options.

'--src=DIR'
     Specify top-level source directory for HandBrake sources.

'--build=DIR'
     Specify destination directory for final product install.  The
     default is to use either 'build' if in the top-level source
     directory, otherwise '.'

'--prefix=DIR'
     Specify destination directory for final product install.  This
     defaults to a reasonable platform-specific value.

'--launch'
     All-in-one option which launches the build and logs output
     automatically.  Useful for novices and quick-start procedures.

'--disable-gtk'
     Disable building the GTK GUI on applicable platforms such as Linux.

'--debug=MODE'
     Select debug mode.  Must be one of 'none', 'min', 'std', 'max'.
     This generally maps to gcc options '-g0', '-g1', '-g2', '-g3'.

'--optimize=MODE'
     Select optimize mode.  Must be one of 'none', 'speed', 'size'.
     This generally maps to gcc options '-g0', '-O0', '-O3', '-Os'.

'--arch=MODE'
     Select build architecture.  The available architectures vary by
     platform.  Most platforms support exactly one architecture except
     Mac OS X which has support for various universal binary
     architectures.  The available choices are hard-coded per platform
     and no sanity checks for the required tools are performed.

'--disable-xcode'
     Disable shunting the build through 'xcodebuild'.  If this option is
     applied, 'HandBrakeCLI' will be produced in a similar fashion as it
     is on other platforms; sans Xcode and the Cocoa application will
     not be produced.  Mac OS X only.

'--xcconfig=MODE'
     Select Xcode project configuration file.  The available modes are
     the basenames of files located in 'macosx/xcconfig/*.xcconfig'
     which direct Xcode to build using various architecture and Mac OS X
     deployment options.  Mac OS X only.

Clean-room procedures dictate that when certain factors change, old
builds should be scrapped and new builds configured.  This is the main
reason for requiring a scratch directory; to promote consistent,
reliable and clean software builds.  The following is a short list of
some of the reasons why someone may choose to scrap an existing build:

   * configure with different options
   * subversion working dir is updated and you want configure to
     re-evaluate working dir metadata.
   * build corruption is suspected

There are generally two methods for scrapping a build.  The 'build'
directory can be recursively removed which has the effect of loosing
your existing configuration but does guarantee no residuals are left
behind.  The other method is to ask the build system to perform an 'make
xclean'.  This is known to work well but will leave empty directories
behind.  However, the configuration is left intact.

5.3 Build
=========

Build main product.  All necessary dependencies are also built if
required.

     make

Parallel builds may optionally be enabled.  Be aware that while a
parallel build may save time on systems with additional cores, the
output is often mixed, overlapped and sometimes even corrupted with
binary characters.  Thus if you experience a build issue, you should
clean and redo the build in default serial mode to produce a readable
log.  The following command allows for up to 4 concurrent jobs via make:

     make -j4

5.4 Make Targets
================

The build system supports passing many kinds of targets some of which
become very useful in normal development cycles.  The targets by
convention are lower-case words passed to 'make'.  Global targets are
one-word targets.  Scoped targets are usually two-words separated by a
period.

5.4.1 Global
------------

'make'
     Alias for 'make build'.

'make build'
     Build main product.  All necessary dependencies are also built if
     required.

'make clean'
     Clean all build output excluding contrib modules.  Configuration is
     retained.

'make install'
     Perform final product(s) install.  This will install build products
     to a standard directory or one specified via 'configure --prefix'
     option.

'make uninstall'
     Perform final product(s) uninstall.  This will uninstall any
     products which may have been previously installed.

'make xclean'
     Clean all build output including contrib modules.  Configuration is
     retained.

'make doc'
     Build auto-generated project documentation.  Various articles are
     produced and may be found in 'build/doc/articles'.

'make doc.post'
     Build auto-generated project documentation and post produced
     articles directly to source tree.

'make report.help'
     Print list of available makefile vars report targets.  These
     reports detail var definitions and expanded values used by the
     build system.  For experts only.

'make report.all'
     Convenience target which aggregates all reports.  For experts only.

5.4.2 General Modules
---------------------

General modules such as 'libhb', 'test' and 'gtk' have the following
scoped targets:

'make MODULE.build'
     Build MODULE.

'make MODULE.clean'
     Clean build output for MODULE.

5.4.3 Contrib Modules
---------------------

Contrib modules such as 'a52dec', 'bzip2', 'faac', 'faad2', 'ffmpeg',
'fontconfig', 'freetype', 'fribidi', 'lame', 'libass', 'libbluray',
'libdca', 'libdvdnav', 'libdvdread', 'libiconv', 'libmkv', 'libogg',
'libsamplerate', 'libtheora', 'libvorbis', 'libxml2', 'mp4v2',
'mpeg2dec', 'x264', 'yasm' and 'zlib' have the following scoped targets:

'make MODULE.fetch'
     Download source tarball from the Internet and save to
     'TOP/downloads' directory.  No check-summing is performed.

'make MODULE.extract'
     Extract source tarball into 'build' tree.

'make MODULE.patch'
     Apply appropriate patches (if any) to module sources.

'make MODULE.configure'
     Configure module sources.  This usually invokes autotool configure.

'make MODULE.build'
     Build module.  This usually invokes autotool build.

'make MODULE.install'
     Install module products such as headers and libraries into 'build'
     tree.  This usually invokes autotool install.

'make MODULE.uninstall'
     Uninstall module products; generally the reverse of install.  This
     usually invokes autotool uninstall.

'make MODULE.clean'
     Clean module; generally the reverse of build.  This usually invokes
     autotool clean.

'make MODULE.xclean'
     Extra clean module; first invokes uninstall then recursively
     removes the module build directory.

5.4.4 Contrib Touch and Untouch
-------------------------------

Also available are some very granular targets which help force builds
from specific cycle points.  The following targets are available to
touch and untouch the respective module target; this will force the
build system to treat the target as satisfied after a touch or
unsatisfied after an untouch:

   * make MODULE.extract.touch
   * make MODULE.extract.untouch
   * make MODULE.patch.touch
   * make MODULE.patch.untouch
   * make MODULE.configure.touch
   * make MODULE.configure.untouch
   * make MODULE.build.touch
   * make MODULE.build.untouch
   * make MODULE.install.touch
   * make MODULE.install.untouch

5.4.5 Contrib Aggregates
------------------------

For convenience, the following targets aggregate the all contrib
modules' respective targets together:

   * make contrib.fetch
   * make contrib.extract
   * make contrib.patch
   * make contrib.configure
   * make contrib.build
   * make contrib.install
   * make contrib.uninstall
   * make contrib.clean
   * make contrib.xclean

5.5 Customizing Make
====================

If the need arises to override settings in the build system (essentially
gnu-make variables) the recommended method is to create optional include
files which are automatically included if present and follow this naming
convention; Do not check these files into the repository:

'_SRC_/custom.defs'
     Custom makevar definitions outside 'build'.  Suitable for settings
     which apply across all builds for a particular checkout; or which
     survives manual removal of 'build'.

'_SRC_/custom.rules'
     Custom make rules outside 'build'.  Suitable for rules which apply
     across all builds for a particular checkout; or which survives
     manual removal of 'build'.

'_BUILD_/GNUmakefile.custom.defs'
     Custom makevar definitions specific to a 'build' directory.

'_BUILD_/GNUmakefile.custom.rules'
     Custom makevar rules specific to a 'build' directory.

The purpose is to allow a place to store local build settings for
testing, tweaking, and experimenting with build configuration without
losing your settings if 'configure' is invoked; ie: 'configure' would
overwrite 'GNUmakefile' and any customizations contained therein would
be lost.  Here is a short example of what the contents of
'_SRC_/custom.defs' might contain:

     ## bump to gcc-4.6 in current path
     GCC.gcc = /usr/bin/gcc-4.6

     ## replace optimize for 'speed' with more aggressive settings
     GCC.args.O.speed = -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -msse4.2

See also 'make report.help' which displays a set of reports used to dump
makefile vars.

5.6 Universal Binaries
======================

This section outlines convenience procedures for creating Universal
Binaries for all the architectures.

     Note: The dummy (container) build configuration uses
     '--disable-xcode'; but the nested architecture builds will all make
     full use of Xcode.

Create a dummy (container) build configuration and use it to launch a
nested-build for each architecture:

     ./configure --disable-xcode
     cd build/
     make ub.build
     make ub.combine

The list of architectures is hard coded to HandBrake's desired product
and currently is composed of combining the binaries produced from two
xcconfigs: osx106.i386 and osx106.x86_64.  The following example shows
how to specify a different list of xcconfigs:

     ./configure --disable-xcode
     cd build/
     make UB.xcconfigs="osx107.i386 osx107.x86_64" ub.build
     make UB.xcconfigs="osx107.i386 osx107.x86_64" ub.combine

6 Building via Xcode.app
************************

6.1 Checkout Sources
====================

Checkout HandBrake from the official source-code repository.

     svn checkout svn://svn.handbrake.fr/HandBrake/trunk hb-trunk
     cd hb-trunk

Sources are checked out from the 'trunk' branch.  This document was
generated from that very branch, and for example purposes, we will use
exactly the same branch.

If you have write-access to the repository, then you may add the
appropriate login/password information as needed.  It is recommended to
use Subversion 1.6.0 or higher.  Lower versions should also work.

6.2 Build
=========

Perform the following steps to build:

   * Finder - navigate to 'macosx/' in the HandBrake source tree
   * Finder - open 'HandBrake.xcodeproj'
   * Xcode workspace - select scheme HandBrake [RELEASE]
   * Xcode menu - select Product -> Build
   * Xcode workspace - Show the Log navigator
   * Xcode workspace Log navigator - select top Build item

6.3 Note: Finding Built Products
================================

Under default Xcode.app options the products from a build are managed by
the Xcode Organizer.  Perform the following steps to open Finder at top
of build tree and navigate to release products:

   * Xcode menu - select Window -> Organizer
   * Xcode organizer - select Projects tab
   * Xcode organizer Projects - select HandBrake item
   * HandBrake item - click Derived Data location arrow (immediately
     right of path)
   * Finder - navigate to Build -> Products -> release

     Note: There is a bug with Xcode Organizer.  The very first time an
     Xcode project is opened the Project view Derived Data is
     greyed-out.  Workaround glitch by selecting any other tab and then
     reselecting Projects tab.

6.4 Note: Workspace Log Behaviors
=================================

The default Workspace behavior does not display latest Build log in the
navigator and quickly becomes tedious.  To automatically switch to Log
navigator and show current log:

   * Xcode menu - select Behaviors -> Edit Behaviors
   * Xcode behaviors - select Build starts
   * navigator - enable, select Show, select Log Navigator
   * nagivate to - select current log

     Note: The Log navigator supports some possibly confusing options.
     It is recommended to only show results for the last build by
     selecting Recent.  If All is selected then it will look as though
     Xcode is performing a build, but in reality it is bringing forward
     log output from prior builds and it becomes impossible to tell if
     any single log entry represents actual work performed or if it was
     brought forward from history.

     Note: When building external target, many 3rd-party contributed
     modules have warnings and errors which may safely be ignored and
     are ignored by the external build system.  Ultimately, look to the
     workspace status indicator for Build Succeeded.

6.5 External Target
===================

The external target mechanism is used to launch a full terminal-based
build from within Xcode.  Unfortunately, we do not have hooks in place
to offer finer-grained control over per-module make actions.  However,
you can still use terminal to accomplish those tasks after launching the
build at least once or doing a clean from within Xcode.  Be careful to
not issue terminal commands simultaneously with Xcode tasks.

Invoking a clean from Xcode always destroys the entire external build
tree and subsequently configures it.  Changing settings in Xcode such as
selecting xcconfig files should always be followed by a clean.  This
allows the external build system configuration to accurately reflect
Xcode project changes.

The following are some examples of using 'make' from the terminal to
effect various components of the external build.  But first, you must
open a terminal at the top of the external build output tree.  Here we
navigate to external build configured for release:

   * Xcode menu - select Window -> Organizer
   * Xcode organizer - select Projects tab
   * Xcode organizer Projects - select HandBrake item
   * HandBrake item - click Derived Data location arrow (immediately
     right of path)
   * Finder - navigate to Build -> Products -> release -> external

Example; external build failed but error is buried in a parallelized
log; redo build sequentially:

     make xclean
     make BUILD.jobs=1

Example; build external x264 module:

     make x264.clean
     make x264

Example; extract, configure, build and install external x264 module:

     make x264.xclean
     make x264.install

Example; something in a big module is failing; redo build sequentially:

     make ffmpeg.clean
     make BUILD.jobs=1 ffmpeg

6.6 User-Defined Settings
=========================

The following user defined settings are visible in Xcode project and are
used for the external build system.

'EXTERNAL_BUILD'
     Do not modify; used to specify the build (scratch) directory.

'EXTERNAL_DRIVER'
     Do not modify; used for internal/external build coordination and
     must always be 'xcode'.

'EXTERNAL_JOBS'
     Specifies the concurrency factor for the external build system when
     builds are launched from within Xcode.  Modify for faster external
     builds if your system has the horsepower and resources.  Specifying
     a value greater than the number of CPU cores (or virtual cores) in
     your system is unlikely to produce gains and will needlessly
     consume extra resources.  A special string value of auto sets the
     factor to the number of active CPUs on the host system.

'EXTERNAL_SRC'
     Do not modify; specifies the top-level source directory for
     HandBrake, relative to Xcode project.

'EXTERNAL_XCCONFIG'
     Do not modify; specifies which xcconfig file is active.  Defined
     inside xcconfig file.

7 Troubleshooting
*****************

When troubleshooting build issues, the following files relative to the
'build/' directory may be especially useful:

'GNUmakefile'
     Top-level makefile which contains build settings generated via
     configure.

'log/config.info.txt'
     Record of output from configure.

'log/config.verbose.txt'
     Record of verbose output from configure.

'log/build.txt'
     Record of output from 'configure --launch'.  Similar output may be
     recorded using 'make' depending on which shell is in use, eg: 'make
     >& log/build.txt' or 'make > log/build.txt 2>&1'.

'log/xcodemake.env.txt'
     Environment (variables) dump as seen when Xcode forks 'make'.  Mac
     OS X only.

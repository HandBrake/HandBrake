1 Introduction
**************

This guide documents the recommended process to build HandBrake on
Linux hosts from the official source-code repository. Building from any
other source is not supported.

2 Prerequisites
***************

The following are the recommended specifications for building on
Linux; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is possible:

   * Intel 32-bit or 64-bit kernel

   * Ubuntu 8.0.4, gcc 4.3.0, yasm 0.7.1.2093

   * Ubuntu 8.10, gcc 4.3.2, yasm 0.7.1.2093

   * Fedora 9, gcc 4.3.0, yasm 0.7.1.2093

   * Fedora 10, gcc 4.3.2, yasm 0.7.1.2093

   * gcc 4.0.0 or higher is reported to work

     Note: It is recommended to use the platform distribution's bundled
     compiler for maximum C++ compatibility. If you build with a custom
     compiler it will likely introduce non-standard runtime
     requirements. There are of course many valid reasons to build with
     unbundled compilers, but be aware it is generally unsupported and
     left as an exercise to the reader.

The following general tools are used on various platforms and it is
recommended you use these versions or similar:

   * subversion - 1.6.2

   * python - Python 2.4.6

   * curl - curl 7.19.4 (or wget)

   * m4 - GNU M4 1.4.6

   * make - GNU Make 3.81

   * patch - Patch 2.5.8

   * tar - GNU tar 1.15.1

   * wget - GNU Wget 1.11.4 (or curl)

The GTK UI introduces some significant extra build requirements. If you
intend to disable building the GUI with `configure --disable-gtk' you
will not need many of these packages installed:

Ubuntu 8.10 packages:
   * build-essential

   * autoconf (gui)

   * intltool (gui)

   * libtool (gui)

   * zlib1g-dev (gui)

   * libbz2-dev

   * libglib2.0-dev (gui)

   * libdbus-glib-1-dev (gui)

   * libgtk2.0-dev (gui)

   * libhal-dev (gui)

   * libhal-storage-dev (gui)

   * libgtkhtml3.14-dev (gui)

   * libnotify-dev (gui)

   * libgstreamer0.10-dev (gui)

   * libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev (gui)

To install these packages:
     sudo apt-get install subversion yasm build-essential \
     autoconf intltool libtool zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libglib2.0-dev \
     libdbus-glib-1-dev libgtk2.0-dev libhal-dev libhal-storage-dev \
     libgtkhtml3.14-dev libnotify-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev \
     libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev

Fedora 10 package groups:
   * Development Tools

   * Development Libraries

   * X Software Development (gui)

   * GNOME Software Development (gui)

To install these package groups:
     sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools" "Development Libraries" \
     "X Software Development" "GNOME Software Development"

Additional Fedora 10 packages:
   * zlib-devel (gui)

   * bzip2-devel

   * dbus-glib-devel (gui)

   * hal-devel (gui)

   * gtkhtml3-devel (gui)

   * libnotify-devel (gui)

   * gstreamer-devel (gui)

   * gstreamer-plugins-base-devel (gui)

To install these packages:
     sudo yum install yasm zlib-devel bzip2-devel \
     dbus-glib-devel hal-devel gtkhtml3-devel libnotify-devel\
     gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel

3 QuickStart
************

This chapter is for building from a terminal/shell environment in as
few commands as possible. Upon completion of the following commands you
should have a fresh build of HandBrake. Further instructions are
available beginning with *Note overview:: which describes procedures
suitable for repeating builds. This chapter should be skipped by those
seeking more than a minimalist build.

     svn checkout svn://svn.handbrake.fr/HandBrake/trunk hb-trunk
     cd hb-trunk
     ./configure --launch

The special option `--launch' selects launch mode and performs the
following steps:

   * assert scratch directory `build/' does not exist

   * create scratch directory `build/'

   * change to directory `build/'

   * launch `make'

   * capture build output to `build/log/build.txt'

   * echo build output

   * print elapsed time

   * indicate if build ultimately succeeded or failed

4 Overview
**********

Linux builds are performed from a terminal. There is no support for
building from any IDEs.

5 Building via Terminal
***********************

5.1 Checkout Sources
====================

Checkout HandBrake from the official source-code repository.

     svn checkout svn://svn.handbrake.fr/HandBrake/trunk hb-trunk
     cd hb-trunk

Sources are checked out from the `trunk' branch. This document was
generated from that very branch, and for example purposes, we will use
exactly the same branch.

If you have write-access to the repository, then you may add the
appropriate login/password information as needed. It is recommended to
use Subversion 1.5.0 or higher. Lower versions should also work.

5.2 Configure
=============

Configure the build system.

     ./configure

Configure will automatically create a scratch build directory `build'
unless you use GNU-style build procedures and first `cd' to a directory
other than top-level source. Additionally you may use `--build' to
specify the directory. The name of the directory is arbitrary but it is
recommended to use something which indicates transient files which are
not checked into the repository.

The `configure' utility accepts many options. It is recommended that
you specify `--help' for the complete list of options. The following
options are also documented here:

`--help'
     List available options.

`--src=DIR'
     Specify top-level source directory for HandBrake sources.

`--build=DIR'
     Specify destination directory for final product install. The
     default is to use either `build' if in the top-level source
     directory, otherwise `.'

`--prefix=DIR'
     Specify destination directory for final product install.  This
     defaults to a reasonable platform-specific value.

`--launch'
     All-in-one option which launches the build and logs output
     automatically.  Useful for novices and quick-start procedures.

`--disable-xcode'
     Disable shunting the build through `xcodebuild'. If this option is
     applied, `HandBrakeCLI' will be produced in a similar fashion as
     it is on other platforms; sans Xcode and the Cocoa application
     will not be produced. Mac OS X only.

`--disable-gtk'
     Disable building the GTK GUI on applicable platforms such as
     Linux.

`--debug=MODE'
     Select debug mode. Must be one of `none', `min', `std', `max'.
     This generally maps to gcc options `-g0', `-g1', `-g2', `-g3'.

`--optimize=MODE'
     Select optimize mode. Must be one of `none', `speed', `size'.
     This generally maps to gcc options `-g0', `-O0', `-O3', `-Os'.

`--arch=MODE'
     Select build architecture. The available architectures vary by
     platform. Most platforms support exactly one architecture except
     Mac OS X which has support for various universal binary
     architectures. The available choices are hard-coded per platform
     and no sanity checks for the required tools are performed.


Clean-room procedures dictate that when certain factors change, old
builds should be scrapped and new builds configured. This is the main
reason for requiring a scratch directory; to promote consistent,
reliable and clean software builds. The following is a short list of
some of the reasons why someone may choose to scrap an existing build:

   * configure with different options

   * subversion working dir is updated and you want configure to
     re-evaluate working dir metadata.

   * build corruption is suspected

There are generally two methods for scrapping a build. The `build'
directory can be recursively removed which has the effect of loosing
your existing configuration but does guarantee no residuals are left
behind. The other method is to ask the build system to perform an `make
xclean'. This is known to work well but will leave empty directories
behind. However, the configuration is left intact.

5.3 Build
=========

Build main product. All necessary dependencies are also built if
required.

     make

Parallel builds may optionally be enabled. Be aware that while a
parallel build may save time on systems with additional cores, the
output is often mixed, overlapped and sometimes even corrupted with
binary characters. Thus if you experience a build issue, you should
clean and redo the build in default serial mode to produce a readable
log. The following command allows for up to 4 concurrent jobs via make:

     make -j4

5.4 Make Targets
================

The build system supports passing many kinds of targets some of which
become very useful in normal development cycles. The targets by
convention are lower-case words passed to `make'. Global targets are
one-word targets. Scoped targets are usually two-words separated by a
period.

5.4.1 Global
------------

`make'
     Alias for `make build'.

`make build'
     Build main product. All necessary dependencies are also built if
     required.

`make clean'
     Clean all build output excluding contrib modules. Configuration is
     retained.

`make install'
     Perform final product(s) install.  This will install build
     products to a standard directory or one specified via `configure
     --prefix' option.

`make uninstall'
     Perform final product(s) uninstall.  This will uninstall any
     products which may have been previously installed.

`make xclean'
     Clean all build output including contrib modules. Configuration is
     retained.

`make doc'
     Build auto-generated project documentation. Various articles are
     produced and may be found in `build/doc/articles'.

`make report.help'
     Print list of available makefile vars report targets.  These
     reports detail var definitions and expanded values used by the
     build system.  For experts only.

`make report.all'
     Convenience target which aggregates all reports.  For experts only.

5.4.2 General Modules
---------------------

General modules such as `libhb', `test' and `gtk' have the following
scoped targets:

`make MODULE.build'
     Build MODULE.

`make MODULE.clean'
     Clean build output for MODULE.

5.4.3 Contrib Modules
---------------------

Contrib modules such as `a52dec', `bzip2', `faac', `faad2', `ffmpeg',
`lame', `libdca', `libdvdread', `libmkv', `libogg', `libsamplerate',
`libtheora', `libvorbis', `mp4v2', `mpeg2dec', `x264' and `zlib' have
the following scoped targets:

`make MODULE.fetch'
     Download source tarball from the Internet and save to
     `TOP/downloads' directory. No check-summing is performed.

`make MODULE.extract'
     Extract source tarball into `build' tree.

`make MODULE.patch'
     Apply appropriate patches (if any) to module sources.

`make MODULE.configure'
     Configure module sources.  This usually invokes autotool configure.

`make MODULE.build'
     Build module.  This usually invokes autotool build.

`make MODULE.install'
     Install module products such as headers and libraries into `build'
     tree.  This usually invokes autotool install.

`make MODULE.uninstall'
     Uninstall module products; generally the reverse of install.  This
     usually invokes autotool uninstall.

`make MODULE.clean'
     Clean module; generally the reverse of build.  This usually
     invokes autotool clean.

`make MODULE.xclean'
     Extra clean module; first invokes uninstall then recursively
     removes the module build directory.

5.4.4 Contrib Touch and Untouch
-------------------------------

Also available are some very granular targets which help force builds
from specific cycle points. The following targets are available to
touch and untouch the respective module target; this will force the
build system to treat the target as satisfied after a touch or
unsatisfied after an untouch:

   * make MODULE.extract.touch

   * make MODULE.extract.untouch

   * make MODULE.patch.touch

   * make MODULE.patch.untouch

   * make MODULE.configure.touch

   * make MODULE.configure.untouch

   * make MODULE.build.touch

   * make MODULE.build.untouch

   * make MODULE.install.touch

   * make MODULE.install.untouch

5.4.5 Contrib Aggregates
------------------------

For convenience, the following targets aggregate the all contrib
modules' respective targets together:

   * make contrib.fetch

   * make contrib.extract

   * make contrib.patch

   * make contrib.configure

   * make contrib.build

   * make contrib.install

   * make contrib.uninstall

   * make contrib.clean

   * make contrib.xclean

5.5 Customizing Make
====================

If the need arises to override settings in the build system
(essentially gnu-make variables) the recommended method is to create
optional include files which are automatically included if present and
follow this naming convention; Do not check these files into the
repository:

`_SRC_/custom.defs'
     Custom makevar definitions outside `build'. Suitable for settings
     which apply across all builds for a particular checkout; or which
     survives manual removal of `build'.

`_SRC_/custom.rules'
     Custom make rules outside `build'. Suitable for rules which apply
     across all builds for a particular checkout; or which survives
     manual removal of `build'.

`_BUILD_/GNUmakefile.custom.defs'
     Custom makevar definitions specific to a `build' directory.

`_BUILD_/GNUmakefile.custom.rules'
     Custom makevar rules specific to a `build' directory.


The purpose is to allow a place to store local build settings for
testing, tweaking, and experimenting with build configuration without
losing your settings if `configure' is invoked; ie: `configure' would
overwrite `GNUmakefile' and any customizations contained therein would
be lost. Here is a short example of what the contents of
`_SRC_/custom.defs' might contain:

     ## bump to gcc-4.2 in current path
     GCC.gcc = gcc-4.2

     ## replace optimize for 'speed' with more aggressive settings
     GCC.args.O.speed = -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -msse4.2

See also `make report.help' which displays a set of reports used to
dump makefile vars.

6 Troubleshooting
*****************

When troubleshooting build issues, the following files relative to the
`build/' directory may be especially useful:

`GNUmakefile'
     Top-level makefile which contains build settings generated via
     configure.

`log/config.info.txt'
     Record of output from configure.

`log/config.verbose.txt'
     Record of verbose output from configure.

`log/build.txt'
     Record of output from `configure --launch'. Similar output may be
     recorded using `make' depending on which shell is in use, eg:
     `make >& log/build.txt' or `make > log/build.txt 2>&1'.

`log/xcodemake.env.txt'
     Environment (variables) dump as seen when Xcode forks `make'.
     Mac OS X only.

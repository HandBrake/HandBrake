# HandBrake News


## Upgrade Notice

Before updating HandBrake, please make sure there are no pending encodes in the queue, and be sure to make a backup of any custom presets and app preferences you have, as they may not be compatible with newer versions.

## HandBrake 1.4.0

### All platforms

#### General
- The HandBrake engine is now 10 and 12bit capable. Please note that not all filters support 10 and 12 bits. Using an 8bit filter will cause the pipeline to run at 8bit. Please see the documentation for more information.
- HDR10 metadata will be passed through from the source file if present. 
- Static Previews that are generated during file scans are now stored in compressed jpeg format (previously stored as YUV420).  Temporary disk space usage and disk writes are massively reduced. This uses libjpeg-turbo

#### Filters
- New Filter: Chroma Smooth
- New Filter: Colourspace Selection. 
- New Filter: Support for QuickSync hardware accelerated Crop/Scale when using full path.

#### Hardware Encoding

- New Encoder: Media Foundation
  - For Windows based ARM64 devices powered by Qualcomm Chipsets. 
- Updates to the AMD VCN encoder:
  - Quality tuning for VCN's constrained vbr rate control mode. Results are the same or better than cqp mode, and bit rate is much more predictable.
  - Included optimised H265 presets for 1080p and 4K content.
- Updates to the Intel QuickSync encoder:
  - Minor performance improvement by skipping VFR and Crop/Scale filters when they are not required. 
  - Overhauled memory management including improved zero-copy support where software filters are not used which should also improve performance. 

#### Audio
- MP2 Audio Passthru support.

#### Subtitles
- New General purpose subtitle decoder
  - Added support for DVB Subtitles (Passthru and Burn-In)
  - Added support for EIA608 Closed Captions.
  - Replaced current decoders for PGS, SRT and SSA  with those in ffmpeg. This should correct a number of rendering issues on Burn-In
- Reduced default CC burn-in font-size.

#### Third-party libraries
- The following 3rd party libraries have changed:
  - ffmpeg 4.4
  - AMF 1.4.18 (AMD VCN encoding)
  - nv-codec-headers 11.0.10.1 (Nvidia NVENC encoding)
  - libmfx 1.34
  - freetype 2.10.4
  - fribidi 1.0.10
  - harfbuzz 2.8.1

The app will still run on Windows 7 and 8.1 however you will receive a message noting that it is not supported (twice) after which it will continue to run. Please note some functionality may not work correctly on these older operating systems and no support will be provided.
- Process Isolation
  - When enabled, any encodes that are started are run under a separate "handbrake.worker.exe" process. 
  - This protects the main UI from any crashes that could occur whilst processing a file and allows the queue to continue.
  - Multiple jobs can be run simultaneously to improve CPU utilisation on high core count systems.
- Audio Tab
  - Minor improvement to the usability of auto-passthru. To prevent confusion, the "auto-passhtru" audio "encoder" option is now only available on the defaults screen and not the main audio tab.

  - Bicubic (OpenCL) (experimental)
    - Available on the Command Line Interface (all platforms) and Windows GUI (Mac / Linux GUIs will come in a later release)
    - Currently only available in OpenCL form so requires an AMD or Intel GPU supporting OpenCL 1.1 or later; Nvidia GPUs are not currently supported
    - When downscaling, up to 5% performance improvement can be achieved; no benefit when not downscaling
    - Small loss in quality over the Lanczos scaler
- Denoise

- The LibAV AAC encoder is now the default as FAAC has been remove
  - This encoder is adequate for most, but until it improves a bit further, we have enabled support for the FDK-AAC encoder also
    - This FDK option is a temporary measure until the LibAV encoder improves
    - Note that FDK-AAC is much slower and will likely bottleneck the encode process, but will produce better quality audio
- H.265 encoder
  - Now available through x265 1.4
  - While this encoder is still fairly new, we have seen some promising results come out of it; it's still under heavy active development and is only going to improve over time

## HandBrake 0.9.3 Snapshot 4 (SVN revision 1896)

### Core Library

- Converts video in other color spaces to YUV420 (this means DV support)
- Official, standards-based AC3-in-MP4
- Tries to base the AV timing for streams off audio when possible
- Keeps some audio fixes for lost packets in over the air streams from interfering with other sources
- Handles rendering of sources where the picture resolution changes mid-stream (this fixes the long-standing bug reading a particular episode of Doctor Who)
- Wider window for clock references (AV sync)
- Fixed a crash when closing out data for AAC encoding on aborted encodes
- Rejiggered verbose activity log display to be more laconic by default
- Updated x264 to r1016, which means b-rdo and bime are gone and replaced with new subme modes
- DTS and HDMV DTS audio support in streams
- Doesn't show the audio track button on iPhones/iPod Touches unless there's more than 1 track
- Tries to avoid garbage data from AC3 sync by searching for two agreeing packets
- As the MPEG4IP project is defunct, switched to an independently maintained libmp4v2 which has folded in all our cumbersome patches
- Fixed SunOS compilation
- Fixed conflict between maxHeight and maxWidth and loose anamorphic
- Warn in the log when titles are being ignored during scan for lack of audio
- Fixed bug with Slow/Slowest deinterlacing and decomb which could leave a flickering line at the top or bottom of the screen
- Extracts audio and subtitle types from DVD sources, to do things like label commentary tracks
- Better handling of the beginning of AVI and WMV sources that start after time 0
- Optimize MP4 for web download works with AC3 tracks now

### Mac GUI

- Nested presets
- Individual activity logs for each encode (stored by default in ~/Application Support/HandBrake, can be co-located with encoded file destination by preference)
- Allows reading from ZFS volumes
- Fixed target size mode. It keeps breaking itself. Maybe it should just be put out of its misery...
- Assorted other improvements

### Windows GUI

- Nested presets
- Individual activity logs for each encode
- Slow and slower deinterlacing and decomb work now in Windows
- Added resizable update window
- Fixed parsing of non-DVD source audio formats
- Restored Copy to Clipboard to the Activity Log Window, among other enhancements to it
- Fixed bug with MKV presets showing up as .m4v
- Assorted other improvements

### Linux GUI (GTK)

- Nested presets
- Individual activity logs for each encode
- Allows pending queue items to be removed, and reloaded in the main window for editing
- Better handling of HD previews
- Assorted other improvements

### CLI

- Updated presets to the equivalent of the nested ones in the GUIs
- Allows setting custom audio track names in MP4 files
- Allows selection of the COLR atom in MP4 files, between Bt.601 and Bt.709
- Fixed reading of device paths in OS X

### A special note on the new presets (they're collapsible-triangle-folder-thing-errific!)

- Deux Six Quatre, Blind, Broke, and Bedlam are gone. They were dead weight.
- iPod Low-Rez is now iPod Classic & iPod Nano
- iPod High-Rez is now iPod Legacy
- iPhone / iPod Touch is now iPhone & iPod Touch, so take care CLI users
- Animation and Television now use the decomb and detelecine (VFR) filters
- High Profile presets now use psy-trellis and the new subme 9 mode with B-frame RD refinement
- AppleTV is now CRF, so sizes will vary with content
- PS3 preset should be fixed
- Constant Quality Rate still needs its quality % lowered, probably

The keen reader is already asking "iPod Legacy? WTF is iPod High-Rez called iPod Legacy now?"

The answer is Universal.

The Universal preset is designed to play on all modern iPods (anything newer than the iPod 5.5G). It also plays on iPhones. It also plays on AppleTVs. It should also play just about anywhere else, hence the name. It is full anamorphic DVD resolution--no tricks with downscaling like stuff from the iTunes Store. It includes chapters, and has the first audio track in both AAC (DPL2 downmixed) and AC3 pass-thru, just like the AppleTV preset. In fact, it should give the same quality as the AppleTV preset, but faster...and at a larger file size. Like the AppleTV preset, it used CRF, so sizes will vary.

## HandBrake 0.9.3 Snapshot 3 (SVN revision 1797)

Translating HandBrake
=====================

Only the OS X interface of HandBrake can be translated at the moment.
Localization is not implemented in BeOS and GTK GUIs.

HandBrake uses the NSLocalizedString() OS X function to translate every
item in the interface. Therefore, you don't need (and mustn't) modify
the nib files. All you have to do is to write a Localizable.strings for
your language. You can get it (for the latest release) at
<http://handbrake.m0k.org/Localizable.strings>.

Edit it with Xcode, save it to HandBrake/macosx/i18n/xx.strings (where
'xx' are the two letters representing your language), then add 'xx' to
the language list in the Jamrules file (in the 'BuildOSXApp' action).

          unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or

     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are

     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You

     Section 3.5.

     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
